# FB Importer

This is a highly specific, possibly not that useful utility that fetches from a Facebook feed, inserts records in a database, and updates Trello if there are any issues. 

This is a sanitized example of some more exotic, possibly illadvised, automation done in the real world.  Requires keys for trello as well as fb keys.
